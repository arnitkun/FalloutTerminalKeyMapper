# FalloutTerminalKeyMapper
Simple app that plays keystroke sounds on your computer like the terminals in Fallout 3 / NV. Also plays terminal start up / shut down sounds anytime you launch mac terminal / iterm2.

# Notes
- Press cmd + shift + ctrl + f to toggle the key stroke sounds on / off.

#Installation
Requires Mac OS X 10. It hasn't been tested on any other versions but it SHOULD work run on earlier versions up to snow leopard.

- Download Xcode and open the project on there.
- Export a binary by selecting product > archive > export > export as a Mac application.
- In order to hear the sounds, you must give permissions to your exported binary under preferences > security & privacy > privacy > Accessibility (add the exported app here)
